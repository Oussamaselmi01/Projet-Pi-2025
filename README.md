This project focuses on centralizing and optimizing environmental data to improve energy efficiency and ensure sustainable resource management within the agri-food industry. The solution integrates a Machine Learning model to predict anomalies in energy consumption and potential equipment failures, combined with an interactive Power BI dashboard for dynamic visualization of environmental and operational KPIs.

The main objectives are to optimize energy resources, reduce energy consumption and CO₂ emissions from equipment, exploit weather conditions to adjust operations, minimize the use of raw materials, and predict energy consumption anomalies. The project also aims to strengthen maintenance strategies by anticipating breakdowns, monitor equipment lifecycle, reduce unplanned downtime, and guarantee environmental compliance by monitoring key environmental indicators and verifying supplier certifications.

In alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the project promotes sustainable energy management, the use of recyclable materials, the reduction of the environmental footprint (CO₂ emissions and water consumption), and the fostering of sustainable supplier partnerships.

Several KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) have been defined to monitor progress:

Total Energy Consumption: Sum of energy consumed per site, equipment, or process.

CO₂ Emissions: Calculation based on energy type and emissions.

Recyclable Materials Rate: Percentage of recyclable raw materials used.

Energy Cost per Unit: Relationship between energy consumption cost and unit price of products.

CO₂ Emissions Yearly Comparison: Tracking reduction objectives compared to previous years.

Average Site Energy Consumption: Energy consumption analysis by equipment installation site.

Suppliers' Environmental Performance: Average renewable energy percentage used by suppliers.

Out-of-Stock Rate: Materials with zero stock to optimize inventory management.

The solution serves three main types of decision-makers. The Environmental Compliance Manager monitors CO₂ emissions, verifies compliance with environmental standards, and assesses supplier certifications. The Energy Efficiency Engineer identifies energy-intensive equipment, optimizes process energy usage, and detects anomalies. Finally, the Maintenance Manager oversees preventive and corrective maintenance, predicts breakdowns to minimize downtime, and reduces maintenance costs.

The technological stack used includes SAP MM and PM modules as the source for procurement, materials, and maintenance data, complemented by Machine Learning models for predictive analysis and Power BI for the design of an operational and environmental performance dashboard.
